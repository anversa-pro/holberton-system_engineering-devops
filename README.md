**Seven things to consider for building an application.**
 1.  Estimating load predictability
 2.  Determining when the traffic shoots up or falls down
 3.  Having a clear idea on the required execution speed
 4.  Realizing how rapidly the application should adapt to unforeseen changes
 5.  Recognizing how fast the scaling should be when the traffic shoots up
 6.  Ascertaining whether your business is global or not (A global traffic spike is different from a local traffic spike)
 7.  Understanding how often you want to perform releases to your application
